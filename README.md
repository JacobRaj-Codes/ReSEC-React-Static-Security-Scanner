Perfect 👍 — here’s a complete **README.md** specifically written for your **React Static Security Scanner Tool** (based on your previous code that analyzes React source files for vulnerabilities using Babel parser and traversal).

You can copy this directly into your project’s `README.md` file.

# 🛡️ React Static Security Scanner

A **static analysis tool** that scans React.js projects for **security vulnerabilities** and **unsafe coding practices**.
It parses React source files using the **Babel parser** and identifies common security flaws such as XSS risks, unsafe DOM manipulations, improper API calls, and insecure component structures.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📂 Recursively scans all `.js` and `.jsx` files in a React project
* 🧠 Uses **@babel/parser** and **@babel/traverse** to analyze the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
* 🔍 Detects:

  * Use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
  * Hardcoded API keys or secrets
  * Insecure HTTP URLs
  * Missing prop validation (`PropTypes`)
  * Direct DOM access (`document.querySelector`, `window`, etc.)
  * Unsanitized user input or eval usage
* 🧾 Generates a detailed **vulnerability report** in the terminal
* 🎨 Uses **Chalk** for color-coded and easy-to-read CLI output

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Component   | Technology           |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| Language    | Node.js (JavaScript) |
| Parser      | @babel/parser        |
| Traversal   | @babel/traverse      |
| CLI Styling | chalk                |
| File System | fs, path             |

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-static-security-scanner.git
cd react-static-security-scanner
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Dependencies required:

```bash
npm install @babel/parser @babel/traverse chalk
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

### Scan a React project

Run the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
node scanner.js
```

> 🧩 Replace `scanner.js` with your actual file name if different (e.g., `main.js`, `app.js`, etc.)

The tool will recursively scan all `.js` and `.jsx` files in your React source folder (default: `src/`) and output any vulnerabilities found.

---

## 📊 Sample Output

```bash
🔍 Scanning project files...

✅ Scanning file: App.js
⚠️  [Warning] Use of dangerouslySetInnerHTML detected in App.js at line 24
🚨 [Critical] Hardcoded API key found in config.js at line 10
⚠️  [Warning] Direct DOM manipulation detected in main.jsx at line 45

Total files scanned: 23  
Total vulnerabilities found: 3
```

## 🧩 Example Vulnerabilities Detected

| Vulnerability             | Description                                    | Severity    |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` | Can lead to XSS if user input is injected.     | ⚠️ Warning  |
| `eval()` usage            | Allows execution of arbitrary code.            | 🚨 Critical |
| Hardcoded secrets         | May expose credentials publicly.               | 🚨 Critical |
| Insecure HTTP URLs        | Should use HTTPS for data transmission.        | ⚠️ Warning  |
| Missing PropTypes         | Reduces type safety and may lead to injection. | ⚠️ Warning  |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (Optional)

You can customize:

* Target folder (default: `src/`)
* File extensions (`.js`, `.jsx`)
* Severity thresholds
* Output mode (console / JSON report)

Example:

```bash
node scanner.js ./my-react-app/src --json
```

---

## 🧪 Example Code (Core Script)

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const parser = require('@babel/parser');
const traverse = require('@babel/traverse').default;

async function main() {
  const chalk = (await import('chalk')).default;
  // ...rest of scanner code
}
main();
```

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Generate detailed HTML or JSON reports
* Add ESLint plugin integration
* Support for TypeScript files (`.tsx`)
* Include automatic fix suggestions

Would you like me to include a **“Detected Vulnerabilities Table” section** in Markdown format that logs vulnerabilities dynamically (for example, to save them in a `report.txt` or `report.json` file)?
It’ll make the tool more professional and useful for CI/CD pipelines.
